# adaptive_knockoff_paper

This is a repository for exactly reproducing the simulation results in the adaptive knockoff paper. The scripts `simulaition1.R` and 'simulation2.R` in the `R`folder reproduce one realization of the the simulations in Section 5.2 and Section 5.3 respectively. One can run the Rscripts in a personal computer. In the paper, each experiment is repeated for 100 times. To reproduce that, one needs to use the bash files in the `bash` folder. The linux command is `bash bash_simulation1.R`.

We also provide a R package `adaptiveKnockoff` which will be constantly updated. To use the lastst version of the package, visit <https://github.com/zhimeir/akn>.
